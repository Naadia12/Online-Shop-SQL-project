Online Shop SQL Queries

Description

This project showcases SQL queries created to manage and analyse data from an online shopâ€™s orders, products, and customers. The queries focus on retrieving, filtering, grouping, and aggregating key information to support business insights. Main tables include Customers, Products, and Orders.

SQL Queries

The queries cover:

* SELECT statements for fetching product and order details
* WHERE clauses to filter by conditions such as dates or categories
* GROUP BY to organise data by attributes like customer or product category
* Aggregation functions (COUNT, AVG, SUM) to calculate totals and averages

 Getting Started

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the `.sql` files in your preferred SQL editor.
3. Run the queries on your SQL database to explore order and product data.

Requirements

* A running SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)
* Tables for Orders, Products, and Customers created with the provided schema

## Example Query

```sql
SELECT COUNT(product_id) AS total_products FROM products;
```
